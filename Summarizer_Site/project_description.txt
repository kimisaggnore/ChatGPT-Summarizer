ChatGPT summarizer.
The idea is to have ChatGPT (AI technology) summarize documents for us.

Requirements:
Ability to put in raw pdf document. Use a pdf converter to turn it into readable text. Use readable as the input into the ChatGPT API.
Interface for users to easily be able to upload the file and see the summary results/ ability to save such results.
Be able to change the type of format (bullet point, paragraph) as a drop down.
Same thing goes for the literacy level for the reader.

Features:
- login system for users to put in their chatGPT private key 
- progress bar to show the progress of the summarizer
- Ability to see summary in a human readable format as well as save the results.
- A intuitive user interface for others to use. 
- Ability for user to choose between types of prompts
