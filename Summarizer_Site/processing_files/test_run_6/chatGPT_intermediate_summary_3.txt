This document is the Blood Component Detector Interface Reference Manual for Introtek International. The manual provides information on different configurations of the Blood Component Detector, including Terminal Mode, Standard Electrical Interface, and Chip Level Integration. The Terminal Mode interface allows for control and operation of the detector using RS-232 communication. The manual also provides a wiring diagram and instructions for connecting the Introtek control board for Terminal Mode communication. To begin Terminal Mode communication, users can press [ctrl] [U]. The manual also includes instructions for zeroing the detector and setting the desired threshold level. The document emphasizes the exclusive property of Introtek International and prohibits any use or reproduction without written permission.This document provides information on how to calibrate and use the Blood Component Detector in Terminal Mode. The data refresh rate in Terminal Mode is slower than in Standard UART configuration for on-screen viewing purposes. The document also lists the user commands available in Terminal Mode, including ctrl U to initiate communication, Z to zero the detector, C to calibrate the detector to the current blood condition, S to manually enter and save a threshold set point, T to perform a self-test, and G to get self-test drive. The document then provides instructions on how to configure HyperTerminal for use with the detector. It also describes the standard electrical interface of the detector, including power supply specifications and pin configurations. In Standard Electrical Interface mode, the blood alarm signal will go high when the blood concentration criterion is exceeded. The document concludes by explaining the user commands available in Standard UART Interface mode, including S to enter and save the blood detection set point and T to perform a self-test.This document provides information about the various commands and their corresponding responses for a sensor. The commands mentioned are G, I, V, Z, Q, D, and C. The 'G' command is used to set and save the LED drive current for a self-test, and it continuously sends the letter 'G' until the correct LED drive is obtained. The 'I' command returns the raw reading of the detector, which is approximately 930 when zeroed. The 'V' command returns the blood detection level in the format 'VXXXX'. The 'Z' command is used to zero the sensor, and it sends repetitive 'Z' characters until it converges to zero, returning 'Y' when calibration is complete. The 'Q' command is used for zero confirmation, returning 'P' for pass and 'F' for fail. The 'D' command displays the blood detection set point in the format 'DXXXX'. The 'C' command is used to calibrate the sensor to the physical blood concentration present in the tube, returning 'CXXX' if the concentration level is greater than 10. If the calibration is not accepted, an 'F' is returned, and if the unit is reset, an 'R' is sent to the host computer.
