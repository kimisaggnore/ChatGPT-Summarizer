Interface Reference Manual 
The Blood Component Detector is available in several configur ations. These configurations 
support different interfaces and are considerat ions based on the intent  or type of design 
integration.  The confi gurations are as follows: 
1)Terminal Mode  – Primarily for test and evaluation.  A desktop computer interface provides
monitoring and set-point control. This configur ation gives good visibilit y and flexibility to the
functionality of the detector. A detector head, PCB and an RS- 232 cable is supplied with this
configuration.
2)Standard Electrical Interface  – Suitable for test and evaluation or OEM applications. A
detector head is supplied with an external PC B and is operated using point-to-point wiring
and electrical logic interface.  See page 83)Chip Level Integration  – An integration package is available from Introtek.  This
integration
 package defines the el ectrical schematic and bill-of-ma terials. This configuration
allows electrical components to be consolidated to your main system PCB.  This represents
the most space efficient and co st effective OEM solution.
Consult your Introtek Sales Representative for mo re information related to this configuration. 
The Terminal Mode interface provides RS-232 communication to control and operate the 
blood component detector.   This is a development t ool to aid in the test and evaluation of the 
detector.  A user friendly co mmand set is provided on the following page. This command set 
provides the standard input and output feature necessary to  operate the blood component 
detector using RS-232.  (A separate command set is available for embedded applications) 
An RS-232 interface cable is suppl ied by Introtek    that is 
exclusively for this application.   This cable allows personal 
computer connectivity, Mac is not supported.  
Microsoft HyperTerminal application is recommend for this 
interface. HyperTerminal is prov ided on PC platforms that have 
Windows 2000 or XP operating system s installed. If Windows 7 or 
Vista is used Hyper Termi nal must be installed.

Terminal Mode 
To begin in terminal mode comm unication press [ctrl] [U]. 
To Zero the detector you first insert a segment of  clear tubing into the detector head.  Then load 
the tubing with clear liquid (saline or water works fine). 
Press [Z] to zero. It will be necessary to zero the detector perio dically or for each new tube insertion. 
Without removing the tube replace the clear liquid in the tube with dilute blood content. The dilute blood content should contain the concent ration of blood that r epresents the desired 
threshold level. Below this concentration no response will occur. Press [C] to calibrate the detector threshol d to the blood component  level in the tube.

Terminal Mode 
The data refresh rate in Terminal Mode is approxim ately once every 0.5 seconds.  This is slower 
than when in the Standard UART configur ation for on-screen viewing purposes. 
The standard UART refresh rate is once every 100ms.
Terminal Mode User Commands:  
Ctrl U = Used to initiate communication between computer termina l and Blood Component 
Detector. 
Z = ZERO - This will normalize t he detector to zero for a given tube insertion.  Tubing with 
clear fluid must be present  during this operation. 
C = CALIBRATE - Allows you to program the detector to a current blood condition. Tubing with 
your blood threshold should be  present for this operation. Note: The detector must be 
zeroed prior to this operation. 
S = SETPOINT - Allows you to manually enter and save a numer ic value threshold set point 
via the keyboard. The detector will save this value.  The format is SXXX. Where XXX is the 
desired value from 0 to 870 (leading zeros not required) followed by (Enter). When the set 
point is changed a G command must be issued  to derive and store the new required LED 
drive current. 
T = SELF-TEST - Asserting a self-test will result  in the output reporting a blood co ndition. 
Note: the detector must be zeroed prior to performing self-test. 
G = GET SELF-TEST DRIVE - Sets and saves the l ed drive current such that the attenuation 
achieved during a self-test will be limited to approx imately 40 counts above the set point. This must 
be reset every time the set point is changed. 
Note:  Either lower or upper case characters may be sent.

Power Supply: 
5.0 VDC @ <50mA for standard 
configurations.  Damage may occur when applying an over voltage condition. 
Zero: 
Zero is to be performed with a tube 
inserted with clear liquid. Asserting a logic high will normalize the detector for each unique tube insertion.  A 10K pull-up resistor is recommended. 
Self-Test: 
Self-Test is to be performed with a tube inserted with clear liquid. Asserting the self-test signal high will simulate a blood condition forcing the Blood Detect output high.  A 10K pull-up resistor is recommended.  
Note:  All input and output connections 
must be made as shown to insure 
proper operation.

Standard Electrical Interface 
In this mode the BC1 can operate as a slave dev ice to a host computer via the two wire serial 
connection or by the standard logic interface.  
The command characters sent to the UART by the host may be either upper or lower case 
characters.  The command characters sent to the BCD will be echoed back in uppercase as 
verification that the request has been receiv
ed.  Immediately following this echoed character the 
requested data is sent. 
All data consists of four numer als including leading zeros. 
The data refresh rate is approximately 100ms. In the Standard Electrical Interf ace mode the blood alarm signal will go to logic high as soon as the 
blood concentration criterion is exceeded.  In the serial two wire mode the BC1 should be 
continually queried.  The retur ned value can then be compared to the stored set point value by the 
host to determine if the blood thres hold level has been reached or exceeded.
Standard UART Interface User Command
s: 
Ctrl <S> (or initial power up) will put the BCD into its default Embedded System Mode. 
S = Enter and save the Bl ood Detection Set Point 
The Format is SXXX. Where XXX is the desired value and it is followed by ‘\r’ (Enter). 
When the set point is changed a G command must be issued to derive and store the new 
required LED drive current. 
The range for XXX is 0 to 870. L eading zeros are not required. 
A received ‘X’ indicates a time out has occurre d and no changes were made. A time out will 
return an ‘X’ in approximately 3 - 4 seconds. 
A valid value acceptance will return the value in a 4 digit format ‘XXXX’. 
A failed attempt will return an ‘F’.

T = Self Test returns ‘P’ for Pass or ‘F’ for Fail (no changes made).  
    Note: If the sensor has not been zero ed it will always re turn ‘F’ for Fail. 
G = GET SELF-TEST DRIVE – Sets and saves the led drive cu
rrent such that the attenuation 
achieved during a self-test will be limited to  approximately 40 counts above the set point. 
   This must be reset every ti me the set point is changed. 
    The letter ‘G’ will be sent repetitively by the detector until the correct led drive has been 
obtained.  The attenuation va lue obtained will be sent upon completion of the process.  
I = INTENSITY – Returns the ra w reading of the detector. When zeroed the value will be 
approximately 930. As the led in tensity increases and decreases so will the number that is 
returned. 
V = Blood Detection Level, Returns ‘VXXXX’ 
Z = Zero Sensor 
    Repetitive ‘Z’ characters are sent from t he BC1 to the host as is converges to zero. ‘Y’ 
character is returned when calibration has completed. 
Q = ZERO CONFIRM - The ZERO CONFIRM polling  shall be performed only immediately after 
the ZERO command.  Returns “P” for Pass and “F” for Fail 
D = Display Blood Detection Set Point, Returns ‘DXXXX’ 
C = Calibrate, This will adjust Set Point to the physical blood concentration present in the 
tube.  If the concentration level is > 10 the detector will return string ‘CXXX’. 
If the value was not accepted an ‘F’ will be returned indicating a failed operation. 
If the unit is reset an “R” will be  sent to the host computer.
