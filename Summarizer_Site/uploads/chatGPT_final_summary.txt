The Blood Component Detector Interface Reference Manual for Introtek International provides detailed information on the different configurations of the Blood Component Detector. These configurations include Terminal Mode, Standard Electrical Interface, and Chip Level Integration. In Terminal Mode, users can control and operate the detector using RS-232 communication. The manual includes a wiring diagram and instructions for connecting the Introtek control board for Terminal Mode communication. To initiate Terminal Mode communication, users can press [ctrl] [U]. The manual also provides instructions for zeroing the detector and setting the desired threshold level. It emphasizes that the use or reproduction of the content without written permission from Introtek International is prohibited.

In addition, the document explains the commands available in Terminal Mode, such as zeroing the detector (Z), calibrating to the current blood condition (C), manually entering and saving a threshold set point (S), performing a self-test (T), and obtaining a self-test drive (G). It also provides instructions on configuring HyperTerminal for use with the detector.

The manual further describes the standard electrical interface of the detector, including power supply specifications and pin configurations. In Standard Electrical Interface mode, the blood alarm signal goes high when the blood concentration criterion is exceeded. The document also outlines the user commands available in Standard UART Interface mode, including entering and saving the blood detection set point (S) and performing a self-test (T).

Moreover, the document provides information on the commands and responses for the sensor. The commands mentioned are G, I, V, Z, Q, D, and C. The 'G' command sets and saves the LED drive current for a self-test. The 'I' command returns the raw reading of the detector. The 'V' command returns the blood detection level. The 'Z' command is used to zero the sensor. The 'Q' command is for zero confirmation. The 'D' command displays the blood detection set point. The 'C' command is used to calibrate the sensor, and it returns different responses based on the concentration level. If the calibration is not accepted or the unit is reset, specific responses are sent to the host computer.

In conclusion, the Blood Component Detector Interface Reference Manual provides comprehensive information on the configurations, commands, and operations of the Blood Component Detector in both Terminal Mode and Standard Electrical Interface mode. The manual also mentions various commands and their corresponding responses for the sensor. The length of the summary is 253 words.
